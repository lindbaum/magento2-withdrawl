# Withdrawal Button for Magento 2

> Magento 2 extension for implementing the EU right of withdrawal via button click.

---

## What is it about?

The EU Directive **(EU) 2023/2673** requires that in the future, consumers must be able to withdraw from online purchase contracts just as easily as they were concluded. **Starting June 19, 2026**, a clearly visible withdrawal button will be mandatory in online shops.

This Magento module provides exactly that: your customers can withdraw orders with just a few clicks – directly from their customer account or via a separate form for guest orders. As a shop operator, you maintain a full overview in the admin area.

---

## What does the module do?

### For your customers

**Withdrawal button in the order overview**

In the *My Account > My Orders* view, a new column appears for each order. There, the customer can see at a glance:

- A **Withdrawal link**, as long as the period is active
- The note **"Withdrawal submitted"**, if a withdrawal has already been made
- The note **"Period expired"**, if the withdrawal period has passed

Additionally, a **"Withdrawal Order"** button is displayed on the order details page.

**Withdrawal detail page**

Refore the actual withdrawal, the customer sees a summary of their order:

- Order number, date, status, total amount
- All ordered items with name, SKU, quantity, and price
- The deadline until which withdrawal is possible, calculated from the date of the last shipment
- A button for final submission ₓ with a preceding security confirmation

**Guest orders**

Customers who ordered without an account can access the withdrawal via a dedicated search form. Entering the order number and email address is sufficient to find the order and initiate the withdrawal.

Accessible at: `/withdrawal/guest/search`

**Confirmation page**

After submission, the customer is redirected to a success page. This confirms that the withdrawal has been received and that an email is on its way.

### For you as a shop operator

**Admin overview of all withdrawals**

Under *Sales > Withdrawals*, you will find a tabular overview of all received withdrawals:

- ID, order number, customer name, email
- Status (Pending / Confirmed / Rejected)
- Date of order and date of withdrawal
- Direct link to the respective order view

All columns can be filtered and sorted.

**Automatic email notification**

Soon as a withdrawal is received, two emails are sent:

1. **To the customer** ₓ Confirmation with order details
2. **To you** – Notification with all relevant data

In addition, you receive a BCC copy of the customer email. The email templates can be customized in the admin panel.

**Note in the order**

Every withdrawal is automatically added as a comment in the order history. This way, it is immediately apparent in the order view that a withdrawal exists.

**Configurable**

In the admin under *Stores > Configuration > Sales > Withdrawal Settings*:

- Enable/Disable the module
- Set recipient address for notifications
- Set withdrawal period in days, counted from the last shipment date (Default: 14)
- Select email sender and templates

## Hyvä Theme Compatibility

If you are using the Hyvä Theme, please install the Hyvä compatibility module:

https://github.com/Zwernemann/magento2-withdrawl-hyva

This module adds the required Hyvä frontend integration for the withdrawal button and ensures compatibility with the Hyvä template system.

The base module remains required.

### REST API

Withdrawal entries can also be retrieved programmatically:

```
GET /rest/V1/zwernemann/withdrawals`
```

Access is protected by ACL permission (`Zwernemann_Withdrawal::withdrawals`).

### Multilingualism

Completely translated into all 24 languages of the EU (97 strings). Further languages can be added via custom CSV files.
